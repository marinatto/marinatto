## Description
  It was made by an undergrad student looking for a scientific research spot as a challenge in the selective process.
  
  This is a project which you can enter a log file containing sensos's data and process this data.
  There're 3 types of processing your data: Modulation, moving average and lowpass Filter.
  
## Usage
  C++ project
  You can change the parameters just in the main function, changing just the constants there.
  Understanding what which process does, it will be easy to know what the constant means.
  Also, there's a python program that you can use to plot every process, the sensor data and the correct output (if you have the answer)
  
## Contributing
  Pull request are welcome. For major chances, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
  
  Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
  
## Project status 
  I intend to do a english version for the comments on the code and a PT-BR version for this README file.
  Also, I intend to implement a few more filter to processs a sensor data in the future.
